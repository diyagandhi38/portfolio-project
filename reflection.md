### Project Overview

This assignment gave me the opportunity to build my personal portfolio using a new AI-based development tool — V0.dev. I wanted to go beyond a basic template and create something clean, responsive, and reflective of my real work. I chose a minimalist style inspired by Diagram on godly.website and used Tailwind CSS and ShadCN components to bring everything together.

### Process & Iterations

I started with a detailed prompt describing the structure and tone I wanted for the site. V0 gave me a solid starting point, but the real work began with iterating the layout, improving styling, and customizing the content.

Here’s what I focused on during the process:
- Used prompt-based changes to modify spacing, card layout, and mobile responsiveness.
- Replaced all placeholder images with real, topic-relevant images — especially for the PCOS Detection project.
- Created multiple prompt iterations to tweak interactivity (hover scaling, shadows), layout spacing, and visual hierarchy.
- Split the layout into five reusable TSX components: HeroSection, Projects, ProjectCard, About, and Contact.
- Cleaned up the layout using Tailwind and made sure everything looked good on both mobile and desktop.
- Deployed the final version live using Vercel.

### What I Learned

Before this assignment, I hadn’t used an AI code generator in a real project. Writing effective prompts turned out to be a skill of its own — I had to be very specific to get the changes I wanted.

This project also helped me think more critically about component structure, visual clarity, and performance. I learned to keep designs modular, and how small changes (like changing padding or grid settings) can completely shift the feel of a layout.

### Final Thoughts

This assignment didn’t feel like just another “build a webpage” task. It pushed me to think like a designer, developer, and communicator all at once. I now have a live, professional portfolio that’s genuinely mine — built from my prompts, my ideas, and my content.

I'm proud of how it turned out — and I now have something I can confidently share with recruiters, peers, and professors alike.
